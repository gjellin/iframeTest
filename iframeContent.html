<p>I keep forgetting to look under that tab. The bookmarklet they used is the one I use as well and I think it is probably what most everyone uses to test that WCAG SC. It is supposed to access first level iframe content but in my experience it doesn't always work. The only way I really know to test with 100% confidence is to access the content directly which it sounds like we can't do. Unfortunately that makes it difficult or impossible to determine if there is a real issue or how to correct it it is. The WCAG guideline itself is not specific about requiring that a page lets users override the styles. What it states is that IF a user can makes those changes it does not negatively effect the content. With that in mind and with no real way to test it I am inclined to suggest closing the ticket.</p>
